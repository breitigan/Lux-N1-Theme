# Lux - N1 Theme
![Lux main view](./img/lux-main.jpg)
Lux is a dark UI theme for the Nylas N1 email client. It is built on top of Jamie Wilson's [Darkside theme](http://jamiewilson.io/darkside).

This version is currently working and stable but is still considered a 'work in progress' and there is a lot of room for improvement.
This theme uses dark background colors with a 'gold' accent color to provide a 'luxurious' look and feel.
